# Aviation-Security
Rare event simulation of aircraft collision using python and scientific libraries. 
Methods used : Monte-Carlo, Importance Sampling, Markov Chains, Lelong and Jourdain adaptative mean algorithm...

We use the model introduced in the work of Paielli and Erzberg [Conflict probability estimation for free flight](https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/10.2514/2.4081) in order to estimate the probability of conflict as well as the distribution in time and space of conflicts between planes.
